= Understand Fuse 7.5 on OpenShift


.Goals
* Benefits of Fuse on OpenShift Benefits
* Understand Administrating tasks for Fuse on OpenShift
* Explaining how to start developing for Fuse on OpenShift

:sectnums:

== Benefits Fuse on OpenShift

* Native integration with Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift
* Transparency in platform changes for developers
* Self-service, scaling, CI/CD for administrators
* Application runtime built for microservice deployments

== Administrators Tasks

The main administrating tasks will typically be

* Installing Fuse imagestreams and templates on the OpenShift 4.x server
* Set up the Fuse Console on OpenShift 4.x
* Installing API Designer on OpenShift 4.x - (http://apicur.io[Apicurio]) (Optional, through OperatorHub)

=== Installing Fuse imagestreams and templates on the OpenShift 4.x server

* ImageStrams, is an OpenShift API object that represent Single virtual view of related images.
* For Installing Fuse imagestreams and templates, You must have the administrator role for the OpenShift project.
+
. Type of Red Hat Fuse 7 images:
.. fuse-karaf-openshift: Camel applications based on Karaf
.. fuse-java-openshift: Camel applications based on standalone Java™ flat file or Spring Boot
.. fuse-eap-openshift: Camel applications based on JBoss EAP
+
. Install Red Hat Fuse 7 images:
+

You can refer to,  https://github.com/rahmed-rh/fuse_on_OCP_7.5/blob/master/scripts/install_fis_7.5.sh[script for installing image streams and templates].

=== Setting up the Fuse Console on OpenShift 4.x

On OpenShift 4.x, you can choose one of these Fuse Console deployment options:

. cluster - The Fuse Console can discover and connect to Fuse applications deployed across multiple namespaces (projects) on the OpenShift cluster. To deploy this template, you must have the administrator role for the OpenShift cluster.
** https://github.com/rahmed-rh/fuse_on_OCP_7.5/blob/master/scripts/install_fuse_console_namespace.sh[script for installing fuse console for cluster]
. namespace - The Fuse Console has access to a specific OpenShift project (namespace). To deploy this template, you must have the administrator role for the OpenShift project.
** https://github.com/rahmed-rh/fuse_on_OCP_7.5/blob/master/scripts/install_fuse_console_cluster.sh[script for installing fuse console for namespace]

== Getting Start for Developer

=== Maven Archetypes

Used to generate new project with required resources and POM dependencies

* Archetype catalog located in Maven repositories:
+
** https://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/groups/public/[Red Hat Fuse]
+
** https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/[Red Hat GA]

=== Archetype types

|spring-boot-cxf-jaxws-archetype
|Demonstrates how to use Apache CXF with Spring Boot based on a fabric8 Java base image. The quickstart uses Spring Boot to configure an application that includes a CXF JAXWS endpoint.

==== Set Up Maven Archetype Catalog in JBoss Developer Studio/Code Ready
. From JBoss Developer Studio, select Preferences.
. Select Maven → Archetypes.
. Select Add Remote Catalog and complete the fields with these values:
. Catalog File: https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/io/fabric8/archetypes/archetypes-catalog/2.2.0.fuse-000092-redhat-2/archetypes-catalog-2.2.0.fuse-000092-redhat-2-archetype-catalog.xml

==== Packaging Process

[#img-packaging-process]
[caption="Figure 2: Fuse on OpenShift Packaging Process"]

==== Deployment with S2I

[#img-s2i-build]
[caption="Figure 3: OpenShift S2I Code Workflow"]
image::./images/s2i_build.png[]

===== Workflow process for S2I Code Workflow

. Code pulled from Git repository, or from developer machine after compression, and copied onto S2I builder image
. S2I builder image pulled from registry into node where build takes place
. Maven build takes place, pulling required dependencies and generating application artifacts
. Docker image created, based on Red Hat Fuse S2I image and containing application artifacts
. Docker image pushed into OpenShift registry
. Container started on OpenShift node

===== Workflow process for S2I Binary Workflow

It is called binary because you Bypass Git repository, and do the build on your local machine and then push the generated binary directly to OpenShift
